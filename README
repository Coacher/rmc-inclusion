rmc-inclusion: the project dedicated to construction and plotting inclusion
graphs of certain ideals M_pi(m,k) called basic Reed-Muller codes (see [0]) and
radical powers in a certain group algebra QH, where Q is a finite field
with characteristic p and size q = p^l and H is a group isomorphic
to (Q, +) - additive group of field Q.

README
------
It is a known fact (see [0]) that in the case of prime field
all basic Reed-Muller codes are simply equal to radical powers.
However, there are no such equalities in the case of non-prime field,
except trivial ones. This program helps to study the layout of these ideals
in a non-prime cases.

This project consists of 3 main parts: librmc, rmc-{diff,ig,short} tools and
a number of small useful utilities.

librmc: library providing a simple interface for working with M_pi(m,k) ideals.
It supports all basic operations, like creation, multiplication, substraction,
intersection and a number of functions to obtain necessary parameters of these
ideals, like dimension.

rmc-diff: a tool to print diff between any M_pi(m, i) ideal and any Rad^j.
Both i and j can be specified and in this case diff only beetwen them is printed.
When given only one index this tool will construct the shortest inclusion chain
with the specified ideal in the middle and the closest ideals of another type
on the sides.

rmc-ig: the most powerful tool which is able to print all needed info
about M_pi(m,k) ideals and radical powers. It is also able to print
inclusion graphs of Ms/Rads and Rad*Ms/Ms. Therefore, it allows to fully
visualize the layout of Ms in QH.

rmc-short: special tool which is dedicated to plotting only Ms/Rads inclusion
graph. However, it doesn't compute ideals directly, but uses some
theoretical results to obtain almost* transitively reduced inclusion graph.
It is much faster than rmc-ig and plots only needed M_pi(m,k), omitting trivial
inclusion chains.
Note: 'almost' means that the graph would be transitively reduced with
possible exceptions to links between consecutive radical powers
which sometimes are redundant. However, this applies only to a very small cases,
namely p = lambda = 2 and even l.

utils: a number of small utilities which are designed to print out some special
info like collisions between Ms and Rad*Ms or simply printing out Qu_i ideals
which form a given M_pi(m,k). Refer to the source code or short help message
provided by each utility.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
All ideals' indexes and most of the other parameters are bounded
by the size of `unsigned long long` type of your machine.
However, this bound is far beyond limits of practical uses of these programs
as with the big number of processed ideals one will get too big and complex
graphs to comprehend.

COMPILATION
-----------
External dependencies are minimal: GMP, CMake and a C compiler.
For building one can use standard cmake building procedure or run script
tools/build.sh from the project's top dir.
